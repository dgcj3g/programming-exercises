## Contributing

I'm trying to make informative and entertaining questions about topics that I like. Interested in contributing to my repo? Fork this repo and start preparing your exercise. After you prepared a exercise about an interesting topic, open a pull request. I'll try to merge as soon as possible. If you found any mistake or you have advice, feel free to open an issue. Here's the format. Please be careful to follow the format for nice and clean repo.

#### Structure

- Exercises must be under [here](exercises), as topic-name.md format.
- If you want to give some materials for exercises, you should put them under a directory which has the **same** name with your exercise. Then put that directory [here](exercises/materials).

#### Theoretical

1. At the first line, use ```### Theoretical - Topic Name```.
2. Give information about topic.
3. Ask the question and show additional materials if available.
4. Write example input and output.
5. Give extra information, resources and links.

#### Practical

1. At the first line, use ```### Practical - Topic Name```.
2. Describe how you write the code.
3. Give code using **suitable** markdown format.

#### Readme

- Append your exercise link with same format.


> Instead of creating exercises, you can contribute via publishing a different approach to a question or solution with different programming language. Feel free to use any programming language, but please be careful to the format. You can ask me anything [from here](demirag16@itu.edu.tr).
