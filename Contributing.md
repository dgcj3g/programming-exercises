### Contributing

I'm trying to make informative and entertaining questions about topics that I like. Interested in contributing to my repo? Here's the format.

##### Structure

- Questions must be under [here](questions), as topic-name.md format.
- Answers must be under [here](answers), as topic-name.md format.
- The name of the question and its answer **must** be same.
- If you want to give some materials for question, you should put them under a directory which has the **same** name with your question. Then put that directory [here](questions/materials).

##### Questions

1. At the first line, use ```### Question - Topic Name```.
2. Give information about topic.
3. Ask the question and show additional materials if available.
4. Write example input and output.
5. Give extra information, resources and links.

##### Answers

1. At the first line, use ```### Answer - Topic Name```.
2. Describe how you write the code.
3. Give code using **suitable** markdown format.

##### README

- Append your question and answer link with same format.

> I'm using Python and C programming languages, if you want to use another please be careful to the format. You can ask me anything [from here](demirag16@itu.edu.tr).
