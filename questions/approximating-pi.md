### Question - Approximating Pi

The number &#960; (pi) is a mathematical constant defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This magical number appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics.

Interestingly, pi is an irrational number, there can be no â€œfinal" digit of pi, because it's an irrational number that never ends. It has infinite digits and it keeps ongoing, forever, without ever repeating. Which means that its value cannot be expressed exactly as a simple fraction.

Since computers can't work with infinite decimals, they need to approximate pi. There are countless number of numerical methods to calculate the value of pi.

Write a program which approximates the value of &#960;
