### Question - Perlin Noise

[Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) is a random sequence generator producing a more natural, harmonic succession of numbers than that of the standard ```random()``` function. It was developed by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and has been used in graphical applications to generate procedural textures, shapes, terrains, and other seemingly organic forms.

Ken Perlin developed this algorithm for Disney's computer animated sci-fi motion picture [Tron (1982)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/). In 1997, he won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for this contribution to CGI.

If you want to learn how this algorithm works, please check out this [Khan Academy lecture](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations/programming-noise/a/perlin-noise).

[Simplex Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise) is an improvement on "classic" perlin noise by Ken Perlin himself. This algorithm has fewer directional artifacts and used in higher dimensions with lower computational overhead.
